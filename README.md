My name is Teresa Hearn and I am currently a student at Fayetteville Technical Community College. I am currently working toward an associates degree in programming and database management. 

For the fall semester of 2025 I look forward to learning more about Java, and Systems Analysis and Design.

My "Foo" - I've been married to my best friend for 18 years so I spend alot of time with him. He is an avid pokemon go player so we are always out playing with the other pokemon go players. 
I am also passionate about my pets who are 2 dogs and a 3 cats, I would like to volunteer at the animal shelters when I can.
